// Now there are five Json attributes that you can use in a Json template.

// 1. name: That's the name of your template.

// 2. layout: That's the layout file that you want to use. By default, it's going to be using the theme.liquid inside of your layout folder. But if you want to use a custom layout, this is where you will be using it.

// 3. wrapper: This is for wrapping your template or page with an HTML tag.

// 4. sections: This is where you will be creating your section IDs and this is where you'll be adding your template sections.

// 5. order: This is the attribute that you're going to use to order the sections that you created in the sections attribute.

// Now keep in mind the only attributes that are required by Json templates are the name, sections and order. The layout and wrapper are both optional.
